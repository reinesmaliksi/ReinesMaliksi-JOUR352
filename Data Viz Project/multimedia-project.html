    <h1>In neighboring Georgia counties, election revealed a growing divide that

  <p>COVINGTON, Ga. — Not long ago, Elizabeth Allen and Wanda Cummings were on
    the same side of America’s political divide.</p>

  <p>Both were reliable Republican voters in a reliably conservative part of a
    reliably red state. But Cummings and Allen have changed, and so has their
    state, Georgia. They just haven’t changed in the same way.</p>

  <p>Allen, a nurse, grew up idolizing Ronald Reagan but couldn’t stomach
    President Trump’s disregard for facts or civility. When she cast a vote for
    Joe Biden this year — helping him to swell his margins in the fast-growing
    suburbs of Newton County and claim Georgia’s 16 electoral votes — it was the
    first time she had ever marked a ballot for a Democrat.</p>

  <p>Cummings, a retired antique store owner, moved from Newton and found
    ideological kinship just across the county line, in rural and ever-redder
    Jasper. She reluctantly backed Trump in 2016. But after his four years in
    office, she — and her new county — turned out for the president with
    gusto.</p>

  <p>Allen and Cummings crossed lines that in America today increasingly
    resemble a chasm. Unlike some previous elections marked by either a blue or
    a red wave, the 2020 vote featured both. And in many parts of the country,
    they crested side-by-side, with the turnout and margin for Trump surging
    next door to areas that boomed for Biden.</p>

  <p>The boundary between Newton and Jasper counties — amid pine forests and cow
  pastures southeast of Atlanta — is one such place. How it evolves will help
  determine whether Georgia stays blue in future presidential contests and, more
  immediately, whether Democrats can take control of the Senate via a pair of
  runoff elections in January.</p>

  <p>The widening gulf between Newton and Jasper — as is true with the divide
  nationally — has many features, but can be summarized in three words:
  diversity, diplomas and density.</p>

  <center><iframe title="Population by race in Jasper &amp;amp; Newton County, Georgia, 2020" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-0ZrKs" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0ZrKs/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="303"></iframe></center>

  <p>On one side, Newton is a fast-developing, multicultural county with
  sprawling housing developments, an increasingly educated population and
  Hollywood and Silicon Valley buoying the local economy. The Confederate
  monument that has loomed over the county’s central square for more than a
  century is on its way out.</p>

  <p>On the other, Jasper is a predominantly White county that has retained far
  more of its traditional character, with large housing lots, farms and
  wide-open vistas dominating a landscape that feels further from Atlanta than
  the 60 miles shown on maps. Here, the Confederate monument will stay — at
  least for now.</p>

  <p>For residents and visitors alike, the differences are stark.</p>

  <p>“When you cross over the line,” said Cummings, “you cross over into a whole
  other country.”</p>

  <p>That the division exists at all is a relatively new phenomenon, and it
  reflects the transformation underway in Georgia that enabled Biden to win in a
  state that had not been carried by a Democrat in nearly 30 years.</p>

  <p>Both counties have traditionally been rural emblems of the Old South, their
  picturesque central squares dominated by clock-tower-topped courthouses.
  Newton was the real-life backdrop to the “Dukes of Hazzard” and “In the Heat
  of the Night.” Locals say either of the counties’ two main cities — Covington
  in Newton, Monticello in Jasper — could be mistaken for Mayberry.</p>

  <p>But Newton has, with time, become more integrated into metro Atlanta.
  Workers commute into the city — just over 30 minutes from Covington to
  downtown — and city residents have moved out to Newton in search of more land
  at lower prices.</p>

  <p>“The county has changed a lot,” said Cedrick Hamm, the third generation of
  his family to operate the Town House Cafe, a Black-owned Covington staple
  since 1965. “You can’t find houses out here anymore. They’ve all been bought
  up.”</p>

  <p>The change has had a pronounced political impact.</p>

  <center><iframe title="2020 presidential election results in Georgia counties" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-OWY27" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OWY27/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="700"></iframe></center>

  <br>

  <p>As recently as 2004, both Newton and Jasper voted overwhelmingly for the
  Republican, George W. Bush, in the presidential race.</p>

  <p>Four years later, the counties began to diverge politically: Jasper voted
  2 to 1 for John McCain, while Newton went for Barack Obama by the barest of
  margins, just over 1 percent.</p>

  <p>Since then, the disparity has only grown. In 2020, amid record-breaking
  turnout, Biden won Newton County by 11 points. Trump won Jasper by 53.</p>

  <p>The political gap reflects a pronounced demographic difference: Newton is
  about three-quarters the size of Jasper, but it has a population that is 10
  times as large. It is wealthier — attracting tech investments as well as
  directors looking to shoot their latest film — and has twice the percentage of
  residents with a college degree. It is also majority minority, while Jasper
  remains nearly 80 percent White.</p>

  <p>Cummings had lived in Newton for 20 years. But when her husband fell ill in
  2018, she closed the family antique store and moved to Jasper, a place where
  political beliefs and values better aligned with her own. It’s become a
  well-worn path for former Newton residents — many of them White — who have
  decided the county is no longer for them and prefer to be farther from the
  city.</p>

  <p>“Newton County has gotten to be a suburb of Atlanta,” Cummings said.
  “Jasper County’s not. It’s still just very laid back and quiet.”</p>

  <p>She had voted for Trump in 2016 as “the lesser of two evils.” Four years
  later, her feelings were very different. “I thoroughly enjoyed him as
  president,” said Cummings, who approvingly described him as acting “like he’s
  a regular guy.”</p>

  <p>Back in Newton, Allen was having the opposite experience. A lifelong
  Republican who learned to revere Reagan from her World War II-veteran
  grandfather, she couldn’t bring herself to vote for Trump in 2016, especially
  after he mocked people with disabilities. But Allen, whose youngest son has
  special needs, couldn’t imagine voting for a Democrat, either.</p>

  <p>This year, the 44-year-old cast her ballot for Biden, a vote she said was
  equal parts repudiation of Trump and endorsement of the Democrat.</p>

  <p>“I’m not saying he’s perfect,” she said. “But he’s a good man. He kind of
  reminds me of John McCain.”</p>

  <p>Allen can trace her family’s history in Newton back five generations, a
  legacy highlighted by both farmers and soldiers.</p>

  <p>“I haven’t asked which side we were on during the Civil War,” she said.
  “Probably the wrong side.”</p>

  <p>But when a movement erupted this summer to banish Newton’s Confederate
  monument from Covington’s central square, following the killing of George
  Floyd, she was all for it.</p>

  <p>Allen, who has seen firsthand the toll of the coronavirus from her post as
  an emergency room nurse, used to be active in the local Republican Party.</p>

  <p>But her change of political heart has cost her friendships. As former
  allies have spun theories about voter fraud, she has piped up on social media
  to set the record straight.</p>

  <p>“They blocked me on Facebook because I was giving facts,” she said. “They
  didn’t seem to like that.”</p>

    side was energized in the election by the cumulative exhaustion over
    President Trump. </figcaption>

  <p>It is just that sort of political vitriol that Ryan Barrett saw feeding
  support for Biden as he spoke with voters across Newton in the campaign’s
  final weeks.</p>

  <p>The 33-year-old head of the Newton County Democrats said his side was
  energized by the country’s cumulative exhaustion. After four years of chaos
  under Trump, “people just wanted things to get back to normal,” said Barrett,
  an emergency room technician when not practicing politics. “People were tired
  of it. They were tired of the ‘Jerry Springer Show.’”</p>

  <p>Not so in Jasper. Along the county’s 300 miles of dirt roads — not to
  mention its paved ones — Make America Great Again flags and signs were
  ubiquitous, even weeks after the vote. In a county won by Trump by a 3-to-1
  margin, it could be hard to find people who did not want four more years.</p>

  <p>“Everybody was pretty happy,” said Mary Patrick, chair of the Jasper
  Republicans. “Like it or not, Trump is very popular. You don’t have somebody
  have rallies with 30,000 people or even 10,000 people if they’re not
  popular.”</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Patrick helped to organize get-out-the-vote efforts for the president in
  Jasper, and found success: In a county of only about 14,000 people, Trump won
  1,400 more votes than he had in 2016.</p>

  <center><iframe title="2020 presidential election results in Jasper &amp;amp; Newton County, Georgia" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-xWw6A" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xWw6A/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="460"></iframe></center>

  <p>But those results — and others like them across rural Georgia — were
  canceled out, and more, by what happened in the cities and suburbs.</p>

  <blockquote><p>“This whole state is going to get more Democratic... Newton
  County is just ahead of the state.”</p></blockquote>

  <p>In Newton, about 8,000 voters turned out for Biden beyond the number that
  backed Hillary Clinton in 2016. The surge stemmed from a concerted voter
  registration drive launched statewide by former gubernatorial candidate
  Stacey Abrams, said Barrett, a veteran of her campaign.</p>

  <p>“Each side dug deeper into their base,” said Emory University political
  science professor Andra Gillespie. “It just so happens that Democrats have
  the growing base.”</p>

  <p>With Georgia’s population becoming more diverse, more urban and better
  educated, there are reasons to think that, with time, Jasper will start to
  resemble Newton. The first test will come in January, when Trump will no
  longer be on the ballot — but two Senate seats and control of the upper
  chamber will be.</p>

  <p>“This whole state is going to get more Democratic,” said Hamm, whose
  down-home cafe is a magnet for local politicians of all stripes. “Newton
  County is just ahead of the state.”</p>

  <p>That is what Patrick, the GOP leader in Jasper, fears, as newcomers priced
  out of the market closer to Atlanta make their way to her county.</p>

  <p>“All we can do here in Jasper is make sure that we try to keep it red and
  that the people moving here aren’t going to try and turn it blue,” she said.
  “That’ll be a big challenge.”</p>

  </figure>

  <p>For now, at least, that sort of transformation seems a distant prospect.</p>

  <p>Bryan Standifer, the first Black mayor of Monticello, backed Biden
  enthusiastically. But few among his White neighbors in Jasper did the same.</p>

  <!-- Pull Quote -->
  <blockquote><p>“Joe Biden got the most votes of any elected president in U.S.
  history... But guess who got the second most? Trump. That tells you
  there’s still a lot of division.”</p></blockquote>

  <p>The president, Standifer said, had played on racism and other divisive
  tactics to win a “cultlike following” that has made it difficult for Black and
  White residents of Jasper to talk politics with one another. That, he said,
  isn’t going away, even when Trump is no longer president.</p>

  <p>“Joe Biden got the most votes of any elected president in U.S. history,”
  Standifer said. “But guess who got the second most? Trump. That tells you
  there’s still a lot of division.”</p>

  <p>Willis reported from Covington and Monticello. Witte reported from
  Washington.</p>
