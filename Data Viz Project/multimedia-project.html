  <p>COVINGTON, Ga. — Not long ago, Elizabeth Allen and Wanda Cummings were on
    the same side of America’s political divide.</p>

  <p>Both were reliable Republican voters in a reliably conservative part of a
    reliably red state. But Cummings and Allen have changed, and so has their
    state, Georgia. They just haven’t changed in the same way.</p>

  <p>Allen, a nurse, grew up idolizing Ronald Reagan but couldn’t stomach
    President Trump’s disregard for facts or civility. When she cast a vote for
    Joe Biden this year — helping him to swell his margins in the fast-growing
    suburbs of Newton County and claim Georgia’s 16 electoral votes — it was the
    first time she had ever marked a ballot for a Democrat.</p>

  <p>Cummings, a retired antique store owner, moved from Newton and found
    ideological kinship just across the county line, in rural and ever-redder
    Jasper. She reluctantly backed Trump in 2016. But after his four years in
    office, she — and her new county — turned out for the president with
    gusto.</p>

  <p>Allen and Cummings crossed lines that in America today increasingly
    resemble a chasm. Unlike some previous elections marked by either a blue or
    a red wave, the 2020 vote featured both. And in many parts of the country,
    they crested side-by-side, with the turnout and margin for Trump surging
    next door to areas that boomed for Biden.</p>

  <p>The boundary between Newton and Jasper counties — amid pine forests and cow
  pastures southeast of Atlanta — is one such place. How it evolves will help
  determine whether Georgia stays blue in future presidential contests and, more
  immediately, whether Democrats can take control of the Senate via a pair of
  runoff elections in January.</p>

  <p>The widening gulf between Newton and Jasper — as is true with the divide
  nationally — has many features, but can be summarized in three words:
  diversity, diplomas and density.</p>

  <p>On one side, Newton is a fast-developing, multicultural county with
  sprawling housing developments, an increasingly educated population and
  Hollywood and Silicon Valley buoying the local economy. The Confederate
  monument that has loomed over the county’s central square for more than a
  century is on its way out.</p>

  <p>On the other, Jasper is a predominantly White county that has retained far
  more of its traditional character, with large housing lots, farms and
  wide-open vistas dominating a landscape that feels further from Atlanta than
  the 60 miles shown on maps. Here, the Confederate monument will stay — at
  least for now.</p>

  <p>For residents and visitors alike, the differences are stark.</p>

  <p>“When you cross over the line,” said Cummings, “you cross over into a whole
  other country.”</p>
